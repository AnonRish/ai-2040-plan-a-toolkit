verification.py

Two independent ways to catch under-reporting, with very different
scaling properties -- which is the actual point of building both instead
of picking one:

AGGREGATE CHECK -- compare the analytically declared_flops() total against
the sum of every node's REPORTED total. Cheap (no auditing needed), but a
single lying node's shortfall gets diluted by every honest node's correct
report as cluster size grows -- see run_evaluation.py for exactly how fast.

SPOT-CHECK AUDIT -- demand a random subset of nodes reveal their full
detailed log. Check (a) the log actually hashes to what was committed
earlier (catches swapping in a fabricated log after the fact) and (b) the
log's own sum matches what the node originally reported (catches a node
that committed an honest log but reported a dishonest summary -- exactly
the attack modeled in cluster.py). Detection probability here depends only
on the audit rate and number of rounds, NOT on cluster size.
